# Lattice data

Since Census has been unreliable at times, we take the data directly out of Census and have pasted it into a file where it is parsed and sent to the TerritoryCalculatorAbstract.

To update this data, visit https://census.daybreakgames.com/get/ps2:v2/map_region?zone_id=2&c:limit=10000&c:join=facility_link%5Eon:facility_id%5Eto:facility_id_a%5Einject_at:facility_links&c:join=map_hex%5Elist:1%5Einject_at:map_hexes%5Eshow:x%27y and paste the content into the files in this folder by zone ID, you cannot do this for Oshur however as that data does not exist.

**Some lattice links in some bases do not exist in Census!** Therefore, the creation of the data is very manual.
